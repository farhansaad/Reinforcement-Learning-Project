# Reinforcement-Learning-Project

This project seeks to culminate in training a neural network to play Space Invaders. Currently this commit has successfully created a CartPole environment through OpenAI gym. I will now try to train a neural network to successfully play CartPole as a first step building towards attempting the same thing in the Space Invaders environment.
